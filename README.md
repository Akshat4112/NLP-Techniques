## NLP Techniques
 
* <b>Tokenization</b>: Tokenization is a very common task in NLP, it is basically a task of chopping a character into pieces, called as token, and throwing away the certain characters at the same time, like punctuation.
* <b>Stop word removal</b>:  Stop Words: A stop word is a commonly used word (such as “the”, “a”, “an”, “in”) that a search engine has been programmed to ignore, both when indexing entries for searching and when retrieving them as the result of a search query.
* <b>Stemming</b>: Stemming is the process of producing morphological variants of a root/base word. Stemming programs are commonly referred to as stemming algorithms or stemmers.
* <b>Lemmatization</b>: Lemmatization is the process of grouping together the different inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item. Lemmatization is similar to stemming but it brings context to the words. So it links words with similar meaning to one word.
